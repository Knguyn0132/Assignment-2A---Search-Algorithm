# Test Case 11: Multi-Goal Planning with Path Dependencies
# Tests the behavior of A*-based Multi-Goal Search (ABMGS) in a directed graph where goal ordering matters.
#
# Expected behavior:
# - ABMGS uses A* to determine the next best goal to visit based on actual path costs
# - The algorithm successfully visits goals 6, 8, and 9 by following path 1→2→4→6→8→6→9
# - However, goal 7 becomes unreachable because:
#   * The algorithm initially selects goal 6 as it appears to have the lowest path cost
#   * Once at goal 6, there's no path back to goal 7 in this directed graph
#   * The algorithm cannot reconsider its initial decision to prioritize goal 6
# - Despite allowing backtracking between goals 6 and 8 (via edge 8→6), goal 7 remains unreachable
# - Demonstrates that even with backtracking capabilities between some nodes, the initial goal
#   selection can still create situations where certain goals become unreachable
# - A truly optimal approach would recognize that starting with goal 7 (via path 1→3→5→7)
#   would allow visiting all four goals in sequence: 7→6→8→6→9
