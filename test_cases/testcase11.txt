# Test Case 11: Multi-Goal Planning with Dead Ends
#
# Tests the behavior of A*-based Multi-Goal Search (ABMGS) in a directed graph with unreachable goals.
#
# Expected behavior:
# - ABMGS uses A* to determine the next best goal to visit based on actual path costs
# - For this directed graph, the algorithm should find a path visiting multiple goals
# - However, due to the directed nature of edges and sequential decision-making:
#   * Some goals become unreachable after certain decisions are made
#   * The algorithm cannot visit all destinations despite their existence in the graph
#   * No backtracking occurs to reconsider the goal visitation order
# - Specifically, after visiting goals 7, 6, and 8, goal 9 becomes unreachable because the algorithm can not backtrack to 6 to get to 9
# - Demonstrates a fundamental limitation of sequential goal selection approaches:
#   even with optimal pathfinding between individual goals, the overall tour may be suboptimal
