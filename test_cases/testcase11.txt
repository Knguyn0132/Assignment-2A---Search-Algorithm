# Test Case 11: Deceptive Heuristics & Memory Efficiency
# Designed to highlight the advantages of IDA* in memory efficiency and avoiding misleading heuristics.
# Expected: GBFS and A* may be lured into the "low-h but high-cost" left-side trap.
# UCS may take longer. IDA* should still find the optimal path with less memory.
