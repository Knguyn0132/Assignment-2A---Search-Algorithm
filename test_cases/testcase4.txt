# Test Case 4: Worst-Case DFS/BFS Test
# A 6-node graph where DFS and BFS will take/expand the worst possible path,  
# UCS, A*, GBFS and Weighted A* will find and expand the optimal shorter path.

Nodes:
1: (1,0)
2: (2,2)
3: (3,4)
4: (5,1)
5: (4,5)
6: (7,0)

Edges:
# Bad path that BFS and DFS will take
(1,2): 2
(2,3): 5
(3,5): 5
(5,6): 5

# Shortest path that UCS, A*, and Weighted A* should take
(1,4): 2
(4,6): 2
