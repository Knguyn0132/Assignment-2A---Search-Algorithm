# Test Case 10: Circular Routes
# Tests handling of cycles in the graph.
# Expected behavior: 
# - All algorithms should successfully find the path to node 5 without getting stuck in cycles
# - DFS will need to track visited nodes to avoid infinite loops
# - A* and UCS should find the optimal path even with cycles present
